# 1.2: Before You Begin

## Step 1: Install binaries

To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors.

\[\[info\]\] \| You can find how to build EOSIO from source [here](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/install/build-from-source/).

The below commands will download binaries for respective operating systems.

### Mac OS X Brew Install:

```text
brew tap eosio/eosio
brew install eosio
```

\[\[info\]\] \| If you don't have Brew installed, follow the installation instructions on the [official Brew website](https://brew.sh/).

### Ubuntu 18.04 Debian Package Install:

```text
wget https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/download/v2.0.0/eosio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./eosio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb
```

### Ubuntu 16.04 Debian Package Install:

```text
wget https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/download/v2.0.0/eosio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-16.04_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./eosio_2.0.0-1-ubuntu-16.04_amd64.deb
```

### CentOS RPM Package Install:

```text
wget https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/download/v2.0.0/eosio-2.0.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install ./eosio-2.0.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

\[\[warning\]\] \| If you have previous versions of eosio installed on your system, please uninstall before proceeding. For detailed instructions, see [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/README.md).

## Step 2: Setup a development directory, stick to it.

You're going to need to pick a directory to work from, it's suggested to create a `contracts` directory somewhere on your local drive.

```text
mkdir contracts
cd contracts
```

## Step 3: Enter your local directory below.

Get the path of that directory and save it for later, as you're going to need it, you can use the following command to get your absolute path.

```text
pwd
```

Enter the absolute path to your contract directory below, and it will be inserted throughout the documentation to make your life a bit easier. _This functionality requires cookies_
