# Platform

Telos is built on the EOSIO platform, here you can learn in depth about EOSIO.

If you do not want to install binaries on your local machine, or if you have other types of restrictions installing binaries, you can try Telos in a web browser at [Telos Studio](https://studio.telos.net).  This is a great way to get started with learning how to write and deploy smart contracts directly to the Telos testnet or mainnet.

## Local development environment

* [Getting Started](development-environment/prerequisites.md): Install the EOSIO platform in your local development environment.
