# Platform

Telos is built on the [EOSIO](https://eos.io) platform, this platform section is based on docs authored by [BlockOne](https://block.one).

If you do not want to install binaries on your local machine, or if you have other types of restrictions installing binaries, you can try Telos in a web browser at [Telos Studio](https://studio.telos.net). This is a great way to get started with learning how to write and deploy smart contracts directly to the Telos testnet or mainnet.

## Local development environment

* [Getting Started](development-environment/prerequisites.md): Install the EOSIO platform in your local development environment.
