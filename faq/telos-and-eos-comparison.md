# Telos and EOS Comparison

## Background

### EOS Post-Launch Blues

While the launch of the first implementation of EOS software, named "EOS.io", was a relative success it soon became clear that the new network had certain issues that many stakeholders felt were suboptimal for dApp development. Among those issues were the following:

**Exchange-Dominated Block Producers:** since voting of block producers \(BP's\) is determined by votes in proportion to number of EOS tokens held, the prevalence of online exchanges saw exchanges utilizing their custody of said tokens to vote their own BPs to positions of high compensation, especially the top 21 block producer spots. In many of those cases the actual value being contributed by these BP's is negligible, while value-creating block producers find it difficult to reach vote levels of high compensation. This phenomenon has forced many of these BP's to search for other implementation of EOS \(dubbed "sister chains"\) to earn enough compensation to continue their business activity.

**Inflation**: while the original inflation rate of EOS.io was proposed to be approximately 5% \(4% to BPs and 1% to a worker proposal system\), voters of the network started pushing to cut these compensation rates in order to, theoretically, help booster the EOS token price during the post-2017 crypto "recession". The eventual BP compensation cut to 1% hurt the bottom lines of many block producers. EOS.io's worker proposal system \(WPS\) was eventually scrapped altogether, reducing the potential for community projects to receive funding from the network.

**Worker Proposal System**: at a time when much of the blockchain ecospace was still recovering from the post-2017 crypto recession that sucked much of the investment money "out of the room", unfunded projects have had a hard time seeking funding from investors, many of whom had been "burnt" by cryptocurrency price volatility and the havoc that is wreaked on fledgling projects and their investors. When EOS.io's worker proposal system was scrapped to reduce inflation, new projects were left with even fewer options for finding funding.

**Rent-Seeking Voter Behavior**: with a relatively high network value \(and thus reasonably-high BP compensation\) the incentive for BPs to implement significant changes, and possible improvements, to the EOS.io network have decreased... causing a phenomenon of BPs not wanting to implement anything that might "rock the boat" and cause a shake-up of influence that might see a top-21 block producer losing their position of influence. As a result, proposals that might alleviate known issues on the network rarely find enough BP support to become implemented. The result is a less-optimized blockchain that is unable to adapt quickly to adversity.

### The Solution: Telos

In light of these issues Douglas Horn, founder of the GoodBlock block production team, set out to create to new blockchain utilizing the EOS software, but with several key changes. Among those changes are the following:

**Prohibition of Exchange Voting**: since EOS blockchains are account-based and take a stance of transparency, tracking which accounts are owned by online cryptocurrency exchanges is an easy task. With this in mind, the new blockchain would prohibit exchanges from voting with the tokens of their users. The result would theoretically be a voting result that could not easily be gamed by exchanges to vote their own BPs into positions of influence.

**Implementation of a Worker Proposal System**: the new blockchain would have a built-in worker proposal system that would see members of the community able to propose tasks for funding. Token-holders would vote on each proposal, and those that meet the threshold would receive the requested funding. Funding would be denominated in the network's native token and would funding would be supplied by a fixed number of tokens on a monthly basis. Left-over funds from each one-month period would carry over into the next monthly cycle.

**Cap of Initial Token Balances**: while the initial issuance of network tokens \(called an "airdrop"\) would be proportional to the balances of each account on the EOS.io blockchain, a cap of 40,000 tokens per account would be enforced for the initial network launch. This cap would help even out the initial distribution of tokens on the new blockchain, reducing the centralization of wealth and voting power.

Ultimately the project was given the name "**Telos**", a Greek word meaning "ultimate purpose or goal". Aristotle is quoted as saying that an acorn's intrinsic telos is to become a fully grown oak tree. For that reason, the project's original logo was that of an acorn.
